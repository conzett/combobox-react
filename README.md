### combobox-react

A simple combobox implementation in react with Bootstrap v3 classes.
Implements a few basic things like:

#### Features

- Basic list filtering
- Disabling the control
- Keybaord navigation
- Custom option styles

Should be easy to read and start hacking on. Uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
to get started quickly.

#### Known Issues (TODOs)

- [ ] Up/down scroll arrows when list is too long
- [ ] Select and active callbacks
